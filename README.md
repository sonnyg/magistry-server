# magistry-server
server component for magistry application

## goals
At a high level, this project is about learning new technologies.
Specifically:
* Node
* JavaScript
* building a REST based service
* experimenting with new architectural patterns
  * functional style programming vs object oriented
  * explore various logging mechanisms
  * different types of asynchronous programming
    
In a nutshell, I'm looking to get my mind out of a box and challenge
my modus operandi.

And, hey, if I get a snazzy little tool to help me manage my card
collection, I'll just be that much better off!
